# AI-Powered-Drug-Discovery-Using-Deep-Learning

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques to accelerate the drug discovery process. The focus will be on predicting the interaction between drug compounds and target proteins, which is a crucial step in the development of new medications. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify potential drug candidates more efficiently, reducing the time and cost associated with drug development.

#### Objectives
###### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess datasets containing drug compounds and protein targets.
###### Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from molecular structures and protein sequences.
###### Model Development: Develop deep learning models to predict drug-target interactions.
###### Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
###### Deployment: Deploy the model to serve predictions via an API.
#### Tools and Technologies
###### Programming Language: Python
###### Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, RDKit (for cheminformatics), BioPython (for bioinformatics), Matplotlib/Seaborn
###### Deployment: Flask/Django for creating a web API, Docker for containerization
#### Data Collection
We will use publicly available datasets such as BindingDB, PubChem, or ChEMBL, which contain information on drug compounds and their interactions with protein targets.
